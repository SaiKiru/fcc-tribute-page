            Augusta Ada King, also known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer, known for her work on the Analytical Engine, a general purpose computer. She was the first to have published an algorithm and is thus known as the first computer programmer.

            <p>Ada was born to a wealthy family of Barons, George Gordon Byron and Anne Isabella Byron. She never got to know her father, who died while she was eight years old. She was often left in the care of her grandmother, and didn't have a close relationship with her mother. As a child, she was often ill. Despite being constantly ill, she developed her mathematical skills. Below is a timeline of how a genius mathematician became the first ever programmer.</p>

            <p>
                <b>1832</b><br />
                Ada discovered her proficiency in mathematics, which will soon dominate her adulthood. She was privately tutored by great professors including Mary Somerville.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1833</b><br />
                Lovelace met Charles Babbage, to which she was introduced to his prototype for the difference engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1835</b><br />
                Ada married Willian, the 8th Baron King, thus becoming the Lady King.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1840</b><br />
                Augustus De Morgan, a mathematician, extended Ada's mathematical studies. Specifically, he taught her advanced calculus topics such as the Bernoulli numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1843</b><br />
                Lovelace published the first algorithm for the Analytical Engine, which was used to compute Bernoulli numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1844</b><br />
                Ada attempted to create a mathematical model for the brain. Her study was never finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1851</b><br />
                She was working on certain productions regarding the relation of maths and music.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1852</b><br />
                Ada Lovelace was struck with cancer and dies at the age of 36. She is buried next to her father in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.
